I have just started my engineering degree so have not yet taken any courses in the undergraduate Major I am interested in. Will I still be able to complete my chosen Major?    Yes. Any student who has commenced their engineering program at ANU prior to 2021 will be able to continue with their chosen undergraduate Major/Minor. This applies regardless of whether you have completed any of the courses listed in the Major/Minor.    
I will be in my second/third year of my engineering degree in 2021? Am I able to switch to a new Major? If you opt to change your Major (for instance, from Biomedical Systems to Mechatronic Systems), any courses that you have successfully completed prior to the implementation of the proposed changes will be accommodated in your new degree or augmentation as much as possible, by way of formally approved and recorded substitutions.  Any courses recently successfully completed that are unable to fit within the new Major (or as electives within your new program more broadly) will be discussed with each student on a case-by-case basis.    
I am trying to achieve a double Major within the four-year period. Will these changes affect course availability and my ability to achieve the double Major?    It's unlikley that your ability to complete a double Major will be negatively impacted by the changes.  Now that the engineering course substitutions have been published, we encourage you to map your remaining studies in the first instance. You can submit a study plan, along with any specific questions or concerns you may have about your ability to achieve a double Major to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ) for review and comment.    
When will the course requirements for Environmental Systems be released, as I’d like to change to that Major?   We plan to introduce a new Environmental Systems undergraduate Major from Semester 1 2022 (subject to formal approval). The new Environmental Systems Major is currently proceeding through ANU approval processes. Courses in the new major are likely to commence in 2022 (3000 level) and 2023 (4000 level). Current students may be able to elect to do the new Major if they plan to graduate at the end of 2023. The detailed course content will be developed during 2021.    
Will the corresponding Minors be affected similarly to the cancelled Majors?    Yes. The approved changes apply to the undergraduate Biomedical Systems and Mechanical & Material Systems Minors as well as the Biomedical Systems and Mechanical & Material Systems Majors.    
As a partner university student will the decision to disestablish particular undergraduate Majors affect me?    As with all of our current ANU Engineering students, our Partnership University students will have the opportunity to complete their original Major. However, specific courses listed within the Majors may vary from what is currently published. Discussions are currently underway with our University partners to keep them informed of our proposed changes and to ensure that courses identified as approved alternates will be suitable for the partner university degree.   
Which undergraduate Majors and postgraduate Augmentations hold professional accreditation?  Many ANU programs and courses are recognised in Australia and internationally through accreditation by professional organisations. The following list outlines which of our undergraduate engineering Majors and postgraduate Augmentations have been awarded full or provisional accreditation with Australia’s peak body Engineers Australia.    Bachelor of Engineering (Honours), and Bachelor of Engineering (Research and Development)(Honours) Majors  Biomedical Systems (discontinued from 2021): provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Electronic and Communication Systems: accredited by Engineers Australia  Mechanical and Material Systems (discontinued from 2021): accredited by Engineers Australia  Mechatronic Systems: accredited by Engineers Australia  Renewable Energy Systems: accredited by Engineers Australia  Environmental Systems (new Major planned from 2022, pending formal approval): pending provisional Engineers Australia accreditation  Master of Engineering Augmentations  Digital Systems and Telecommunications (discontinued from 2021): provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Mechatronics: provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Photonics: not accredited  Renewable Energy: provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Electrical Engineering: not accredited  Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision: not accredited    
When will teach-out plans and the list of approved substitute courses be available? The approved course substitutions are now available on our website. See: Engineering course substitutions  We encourage all engineering students to familiarise themselves with the approved replacements and build your study plan accordingly.  If you require specific feedback on your study plan, you are welcome to submit a study plan to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ) for review and comment. We will provide guidance to ensure you have the opportunity to complete your degree and chosen Major/Minor/Augmentation on time and to help make this a smooth transition.    
Which courses will be removed and when will this occur? The approved course substitutions are now available on our website. See: Engineering course substitutions  We encourage all engineering students to familiarise themselves with the approved replacements and build your study plan accordingly.  The approved changes came into effect on 1 January 2021.
