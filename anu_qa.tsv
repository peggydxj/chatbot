I have just started my engineering degree so have not yet taken any courses in the undergraduate Major I am interested in. Will I still be able to complete my chosen Major?    Yes. Any student who has commenced their engineering program at ANU prior to 2021 will be able to continue with their chosen undergraduate Major/Minor. This applies regardless of whether you have completed any of the courses listed in the Major/Minor.    
I will be in my second/third year of my engineering degree in 2021? Am I able to switch to a new Major? If you opt to change your Major (for instance, from Biomedical Systems to Mechatronic Systems), any courses that you have successfully completed prior to the implementation of the proposed changes will be accommodated in your new degree or augmentation as much as possible, by way of formally approved and recorded substitutions.  Any courses recently successfully completed that are unable to fit within the new Major (or as electives within your new program more broadly) will be discussed with each student on a case-by-case basis.    
I am trying to achieve a double Major within the four-year period. Will these changes affect course availability and my ability to achieve the double Major?    It's unlikley that your ability to complete a double Major will be negatively impacted by the changes.  Now that the engineering course substitutions have been published, we encourage you to map your remaining studies in the first instance. You can submit a study plan, along with any specific questions or concerns you may have about your ability to achieve a double Major to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ) for review and comment.    
When will the course requirements for Environmental Systems be released, as I’d like to change to that Major?   We plan to introduce a new Environmental Systems undergraduate Major from Semester 1 2022 (subject to formal approval). The new Environmental Systems Major is currently proceeding through ANU approval processes. Courses in the new major are likely to commence in 2022 (3000 level) and 2023 (4000 level). Current students may be able to elect to do the new Major if they plan to graduate at the end of 2023. The detailed course content will be developed during 2021.    
Will the corresponding Minors be affected similarly to the cancelled Majors?    Yes. The approved changes apply to the undergraduate Biomedical Systems and Mechanical & Material Systems Minors as well as the Biomedical Systems and Mechanical & Material Systems Majors.    
As a partner university student will the decision to disestablish particular undergraduate Majors affect me?    As with all of our current ANU Engineering students, our Partnership University students will have the opportunity to complete their original Major. However, specific courses listed within the Majors may vary from what is currently published. Discussions are currently underway with our University partners to keep them informed of our proposed changes and to ensure that courses identified as approved alternates will be suitable for the partner university degree.   
Which undergraduate Majors and postgraduate Augmentations hold professional accreditation?  Many ANU programs and courses are recognised in Australia and internationally through accreditation by professional organisations. The following list outlines which of our undergraduate engineering Majors and postgraduate Augmentations have been awarded full or provisional accreditation with Australia’s peak body Engineers Australia.    Bachelor of Engineering (Honours), and Bachelor of Engineering (Research and Development)(Honours) Majors  Biomedical Systems (discontinued from 2021): provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Electronic and Communication Systems: accredited by Engineers Australia  Mechanical and Material Systems (discontinued from 2021): accredited by Engineers Australia  Mechatronic Systems: accredited by Engineers Australia  Renewable Energy Systems: accredited by Engineers Australia  Environmental Systems (new Major planned from 2022, pending formal approval): pending provisional Engineers Australia accreditation  Master of Engineering Augmentations  Digital Systems and Telecommunications (discontinued from 2021): provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Mechatronics: provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Photonics: not accredited  Renewable Energy: provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Electrical Engineering: not accredited  Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision: not accredited    
When will teach-out plans and the list of approved substitute courses be available? The approved course substitutions are now available on our website. See: Engineering course substitutions  We encourage all engineering students to familiarise themselves with the approved replacements and build your study plan accordingly.  If you require specific feedback on your study plan, you are welcome to submit a study plan to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ) for review and comment. We will provide guidance to ensure you have the opportunity to complete your degree and chosen Major/Minor/Augmentation on time and to help make this a smooth transition.    
Which courses will be removed and when will this occur? The approved course substitutions are now available on our website. See: Engineering course substitutions  We encourage all engineering students to familiarise themselves with the approved replacements and build your study plan accordingly.  The approved changes came into effect on 1 January 2021.    
Will the selection of the alternate courses be at our own discretion or is this something that you will decide and provide for us?  The approved alternate courses have been specified by the Research School. You will not need to try to identify replacement courses on your own.  See: Engineering course substitutions   
Will it be possible to study courses with another university to complete my Major/Minor/Augmentation?   Specific external courses offered by other top Australian universities may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Students will need to make a strong case as to why they are unable to complete the approved ANU course substitute.  Please first review the approved course substitutions on our website (see: Engineering course substitutions ). If you believe you may be unnecessarily disadvantaged by completing the approved replacement ANU course, and wish to submit an alternate, external course for consideration, then you will need to submit this request.  You must provide a personal statement detailing your circumstances and the published course outline for the course that you’ve identified to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ). This request will then be considered by the relevant Delegated Authority and a formal decision will be communicated to you (and recorded on your internal record). If the courses I have completed to date can’t count towards my new program or Major, will I be permitted to Late Withdraw from these courses and receive a tuition fee refund?  CECC Student Services will work with you and the Research School to find the best fit for the courses you have successfully completed to date in your program. We will record approved substitutions to ensure there is no confusion at the time of graduation. We will also identify which courses you have remaining to complete under your new program rules, so that you can make an informed decision about your study plans. Where courses that have been successfully completed within the last 12 months are identified as surplus to your new program requirements, and are therefore not able to fit within the new program, Student Services will discuss the options available to you that align with your individual circumstances.    
I'd like to transfer to a completely different degree program, as my current Major/Augmentation is being disestablished. How do I do this?  If you decide that you would like to transfer to an entirely different program as a result of the approved changes (for example, to move from the Master of Engineering to the Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision), you will need to submit an application for Program Transfer. For transfers to be effective from Semester 1 2021, you must submit a completed application by no later than 31 October 2020.  More information: Transferring between degrees    
If I choose to transfer to another postgraduate Augmentation or program, will the courses I have successfully completed under my original program be credited to my new degree?     If you choose to change your postgraduate Augmentation or program to a completely different engineering discipline, you may find that this extends your overall program duration. It will depend on how far through your current degree you are. If this is the case, this will be explicitly identified as part of your study plan discussion with CECC Student Services, so that you can make an informed decision about your options.    
Will current ANU students who transfer into an engineering program from 2021 be able to complete one of the disestablished Majors/Minors/Augmentations? Or are they treated as a new commencing student?    Students who transfer into an ANU engineering degree from 2021 will typically be expected to complete their studies under the year rules that they commence their engineering program. For example, if you transfer from a Bachelor of Science to a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in 2021, you will be expected to follow the new 2021 program rules.  This may mean that the Majors/Minors/Augmentations approved for disestablishment are not available if you commence your engineering studies at ANU from Semester 1 2021. However, the College is happy to discuss transfer students' individual circumstances and Major/Minor. Augmentation options can be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.    
Should I contact CECS Student Service for a study plan now? The approved course substitutions are now available on our website. See: Engineering course substitutions  We encourage all engineering students to familiarise themselves with the approved replacements and build your study plan accordingly.  If you require specific feedback on your study plan, you are welcome to submit a study plan to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ) for review and comment.    
Do I need to do/action something?   If you are an undergraduate engineering student who has not yet identified a Major/Minor, please do so as soon as possible on ISIS so that we know of your intention. This will assist with our planning. You can update your academic record to reflect your intended Major or Minor via ISIS. Instructions on how to do this can be found on the ANU Current Students website.  More information: Changing majors, minors & specialisations  No further action is required from current students at this stage.   
I have a question that’s not answered here. Who do I contact?   If you have another question about the changes to the engineering programs, you can submit this directly to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au . Please ensure to include your ANUID and a detailed explanation of your query in your email, so that we are able to provide you with information relevant to your personal circumstances.

Bachelor of Engineering (Honours), and Bachelor of Engineering (Research and Development)(Honours) Majors  Biomedical Systems (discontinued from 2021): provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Electronic and Communication Systems: accredited by Engineers Australia  Mechanical and Material Systems (discontinued from 2021): accredited by Engineers Australia  Mechatronic Systems: accredited by Engineers Australia  Renewable Energy Systems: accredited by Engineers Australia  Environmental Systems (new Major planned from 2022, pending formal approval): pending provisional Engineers Australia accreditation  Master of Engineering Augmentations  Digital Systems and Telecommunications (discontinued from 2021): provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Mechatronics: provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Photonics: not accredited  Renewable Energy: provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Electrical Engineering: not accredited  Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision: not accredited    
When will teach-out plans and the list of approved substitute courses be available? The approved course substitutions are now available on our website. See: Engineering course substitutions  We encourage all engineering students to familiarise themselves with the approved replacements and build your study plan accordingly.  If you require specific feedback on your study plan, you are welcome to submit a study plan to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ) for review and comment. We will provide guidance to ensure you have the opportunity to complete your degree and chosen Major/Minor/Augmentation on time and to help make this a smooth transition.    
Which courses will be removed and when will this occur? The approved course substitutions are now available on our website. See: Engineering course substitutions  We encourage all engineering students to familiarise themselves with the approved replacements and build your study plan accordingly.  The approved changes came into effect on 1 January 2021.    
Will the selection of the alternate courses be at our own discretion or is this something that you will decide and provide for us?  The approved alternate courses have been specified by the Research School. You will not need to try to identify replacement courses on your own.  See: Engineering course substitutions   
Will it be possible to study courses with another university to complete my Major/Minor/Augmentation?   Specific external courses offered by other top Australian universities may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Students will need to make a strong case as to why they are unable to complete the approved ANU course substitute.  Please first review the approved course substitutions on our website (see: Engineering course substitutions ). If you believe you may be unnecessarily disadvantaged by completing the approved replacement ANU course, and wish to submit an alternate, external course for consideration, then you will need to submit this request.  You must provide a personal statement detailing your circumstances and the published course outline for the course that you’ve identified to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ). This request will then be considered by the relevant Delegated Authority and a formal decision will be communicated to you (and recorded on your internal record). If the courses I have completed to date can’t count towards my new program or Major, will I be permitted to Late Withdraw from these courses and receive a tuition fee refund?  CECC Student Services will work with you and the Research School to find the best fit for the courses you have successfully completed to date in your program. We will record approved substitutions to ensure there is no confusion at the time of graduation. We will also identify which courses you have remaining to complete under your new program rules, so that you can make an informed decision about your study plans. Where courses that have been successfully completed within the last 12 months are identified as surplus to your new program requirements, and are therefore not able to fit within the new program, Student Services will discuss the options available to you that align with your individual circumstances.    
I'd like to transfer to a completely different degree program, as my current Major/Augmentation is being disestablished. How do I do this?  If you decide that you would like to transfer to an entirely different program as a result of the approved changes (for example, to move from the Master of Engineering to the Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision), you will need to submit an application for Program Transfer. For transfers to be effective from Semester 1 2021, you must submit a completed application by no later than 31 October 2020.  More information: Transferring between degrees    
If I choose to transfer to another postgraduate Augmentation or program, will the courses I have successfully completed under my original program be credited to my new degree?     If you choose to change your postgraduate Augmentation or program to a completely different engineering discipline, you may find that this extends your overall program duration. It will depend on how far through your current degree you are. If this is the case, this will be explicitly identified as part of your study plan discussion with CECC Student Services, so that you can make an informed decision about your options.    
Will current ANU students who transfer into an engineering program from 2021 be able to complete one of the disestablished Majors/Minors/Augmentations? Or are they treated as a new commencing student?    Students who transfer into an ANU engineering degree from 2021 will typically be expected to complete their studies under the year rules that they commence their engineering program. For example, if you transfer from a Bachelor of Science to a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in 2021, you will be expected to follow the new 2021 program rules.  This may mean that the Majors/Minors/Augmentations approved for disestablishment are not available if you commence your engineering studies at ANU from Semester 1 2021. However, the College is happy to discuss transfer students' individual circumstances and Major/Minor. Augmentation options can be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.    
Should I contact CECS Student Service for a study plan now? The approved course substitutions are now available on our website. See: Engineering course substitutions  We encourage all engineering students to familiarise themselves with the approved replacements and build your study plan accordingly.  If you require specific feedback on your study plan, you are welcome to submit a study plan to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ) for review and comment.    
Do I need to do/action something?   If you are an undergraduate engineering student who has not yet identified a Major/Minor, please do so as soon as possible on ISIS so that we know of your intention. This will assist with our planning. You can update your academic record to reflect your intended Major or Minor via ISIS. Instructions on how to do this can be found on the ANU Current Students website.  More information: Changing majors, minors & specialisations  No further action is required from current students at this stage.   
I have a question that’s not answered here. Who do I contact?   If you have another question about the changes to the engineering programs, you can submit this directly to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au . Please ensure to include your ANUID and a detailed explanation of your query in your email, so that we are able to provide you with information relevant to your personal circumstances. 
I have just started my engineering degree so have not yet taken any courses in the undergraduate Major I am interested in. Will I still be able to complete my chosen Major?    Yes. Any student who has commenced their engineering program at ANU prior to 2021 will be able to continue with their chosen undergraduate Major/Minor. This applies regardless of whether you have completed any of the courses listed in the Major/Minor.    
I will be in my second/third year of my engineering degree in 2021? Am I able to switch to a new Major? If you opt to change your Major (for instance, from Biomedical Systems to Mechatronic Systems), any courses that you have successfully completed prior to the implementation of the proposed changes will be accommodated in your new degree or augmentation as much as possible, by way of formally approved and recorded substitutions.  Any courses recently successfully completed that are unable to fit within the new Major (or as electives within your new program more broadly) will be discussed with each student on a case-by-case basis.    
I am trying to achieve a double Major within the four-year period. Will these changes affect course availability and my ability to achieve the double Major?    It's unlikley that your ability to complete a double Major will be negatively impacted by the changes.  Now that the engineering course substitutions have been published, we encourage you to map your remaining studies in the first instance. You can submit a study plan, along with any specific questions or concerns you may have about your ability to achieve a double Major to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ) for review and comment.    
When will the course requirements for Environmental Systems be released, as I’d like to change to that Major?   We plan to introduce a new Environmental Systems undergraduate Major from Semester 1 2022 (subject to formal approval). The new Environmental Systems Major is currently proceeding through ANU approval processes. Courses in the new major are likely to commence in 2022 (3000 level) and 2023 (4000 level). Current students may be able to elect to do the new Major if they plan to graduate at the end of 2023. The detailed course content will be developed during 2021.    
Will the corresponding Minors be affected similarly to the cancelled Majors?    Yes. The approved changes apply to the undergraduate Biomedical Systems and Mechanical & Material Systems Minors as well as the Biomedical Systems and Mechanical & Material Systems Majors.    
As a partner university student will the decision to disestablish particular undergraduate Majors affect me?    As with all of our current ANU Engineering students, our Partnership University students will have the opportunity to complete their original Major. However, specific courses listed within the Majors may vary from what is currently published. Discussions are currently underway with our University partners to keep them informed of our proposed changes and to ensure that courses identified as approved alternates will be suitable for the partner university degree.

I'd like to transfer to a completely different degree program, as my current Major/Augmentation is being disestablished. How do I do this?  If you decide that you would like to transfer to an entirely different program as a result of the approved changes (for example, to move from the Master of Engineering to the Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision), you will need to submit an application for Program Transfer. For transfers to be effective from Semester 1 2021, you must submit a completed application by no later than 31 October 2020.  More information: Transferring between degrees    
If I choose to transfer to another postgraduate Augmentation or program, will the courses I have successfully completed under my original program be credited to my new degree?     If you choose to change your postgraduate Augmentation or program to a completely different engineering discipline, you may find that this extends your overall program duration. It will depend on how far through your current degree you are. If this is the case, this will be explicitly identified as part of your study plan discussion with CECC Student Services, so that you can make an informed decision about your options.    
Will current ANU students who transfer into an engineering program from 2021 be able to complete one of the disestablished Majors/Minors/Augmentations? Or are they treated as a new commencing student?    Students who transfer into an ANU engineering degree from 2021 will typically be expected to complete their studies under the year rules that they commence their engineering program. For example, if you transfer from a Bachelor of Science to a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in 2021, you will be expected to follow the new 2021 program rules.  This may mean that the Majors/Minors/Augmentations approved for disestablishment are not available if you commence your engineering studies at ANU from Semester 1 2021. However, the College is happy to discuss transfer students' individual circumstances and Major/Minor. Augmentation options can be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.    
Should I contact CECS Student Service for a study plan now? The approved course substitutions are now available on our website. See: Engineering course substitutions  We encourage all engineering students to familiarise themselves with the approved replacements and build your study plan accordingly.  If you require specific feedback on your study plan, you are welcome to submit a study plan to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ) for review and comment.    
Do I need to do/action something?   If you are an undergraduate engineering student who has not yet identified a Major/Minor, please do so as soon as possible on ISIS so that we know of your intention. This will assist with our planning. You can update your academic record to reflect your intended Major or Minor via ISIS. Instructions on how to do this can be found on the ANU Current Students website.  More information: Changing majors, minors & specialisations  No further action is required from current students at this stage.   
I have a question that’s not answered here. Who do I contact?   If you have another question about the changes to the engineering programs, you can submit this directly to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au . Please ensure to include your ANUID and a detailed explanation of your query in your email, so that we are able to provide you with information relevant to your personal circumstances. 
I have just started my engineering degree so have not yet taken any courses in the undergraduate Major I am interested in. Will I still be able to complete my chosen Major?    Yes. Any student who has commenced their engineering program at ANU prior to 2021 will be able to continue with their chosen undergraduate Major/Minor. This applies regardless of whether you have completed any of the courses listed in the Major/Minor.    
I will be in my second/third year of my engineering degree in 2021? Am I able to switch to a new Major? If you opt to change your Major (for instance, from Biomedical Systems to Mechatronic Systems), any courses that you have successfully completed prior to the implementation of the proposed changes will be accommodated in your new degree or augmentation as much as possible, by way of formally approved and recorded substitutions.  Any courses recently successfully completed that are unable to fit within the new Major (or as electives within your new program more broadly) will be discussed with each student on a case-by-case basis.    
I am trying to achieve a double Major within the four-year period. Will these changes affect course availability and my ability to achieve the double Major?    It's unlikley that your ability to complete a double Major will be negatively impacted by the changes.  Now that the engineering course substitutions have been published, we encourage you to map your remaining studies in the first instance. You can submit a study plan, along with any specific questions or concerns you may have about your ability to achieve a double Major to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ) for review and comment.    
When will the course requirements for Environmental Systems be released, as I’d like to change to that Major?   We plan to introduce a new Environmental Systems undergraduate Major from Semester 1 2022 (subject to formal approval). The new Environmental Systems Major is currently proceeding through ANU approval processes. Courses in the new major are likely to commence in 2022 (3000 level) and 2023 (4000 level). Current students may be able to elect to do the new Major if they plan to graduate at the end of 2023. The detailed course content will be developed during 2021.    
Will the corresponding Minors be affected similarly to the cancelled Majors?    Yes. The approved changes apply to the undergraduate Biomedical Systems and Mechanical & Material Systems Minors as well as the Biomedical Systems and Mechanical & Material Systems Majors.    
As a partner university student will the decision to disestablish particular undergraduate Majors affect me?    As with all of our current ANU Engineering students, our Partnership University students will have the opportunity to complete their original Major. However, specific courses listed within the Majors may vary from what is currently published. Discussions are currently underway with our University partners to keep them informed of our proposed changes and to ensure that courses identified as approved alternates will be suitable for the partner university degree.   
Which undergraduate Majors and postgraduate Augmentations hold professional accreditation?  Many ANU programs and courses are recognised in Australia and internationally through accreditation by professional organisations. The following list outlines which of our undergraduate engineering Majors and postgraduate Augmentations have been awarded full or provisional accreditation with Australia’s peak body Engineers Australia.    Bachelor of Engineering (Honours), and Bachelor of Engineering (Research and Development)(Honours) Majors  Biomedical Systems (discontinued from 2021): provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Electronic and Communication Systems: accredited by Engineers Australia  Mechanical and Material Systems (discontinued from 2021): accredited by Engineers Australia  Mechatronic Systems: accredited by Engineers Australia  Renewable Energy Systems: accredited by Engineers Australia  Environmental Systems (new Major planned from 2022, pending formal approval): pending provisional Engineers Australia accreditation  Master of Engineering Augmentations  Digital Systems and Telecommunications (discontinued from 2021): provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Mechatronics: provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Photonics: not accredited  Renewable Energy: provisionally accredited by Engineers Australia  Electrical Engineering: not accredited  Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision: not accredited    
When will teach-out plans and the list of approved substitute courses be available? The approved course substitutions are now available on our website. See: Engineering course substitutions  We encourage all engineering students to familiarise themselves with the approved replacements and build your study plan accordingly.  If you require specific feedback on your study plan, you are welcome to submit a study plan to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ) for review and comment. We will provide guidance to ensure you have the opportunity to complete your degree and chosen Major/Minor/Augmentation on time and to help make this a smooth transition.    
Which courses will be removed and when will this occur? The approved course substitutions are now available on our website. See: Engineering course substitutions  We encourage all engineering students to familiarise themselves with the approved replacements and build your study plan accordingly.  The approved changes came into effect on 1 January 2021.    
Will the selection of the alternate courses be at our own discretion or is this something that you will decide and provide for us?  The approved alternate courses have been specified by the Research School. You will not need to try to identify replacement courses on your own.  See: Engineering course substitutions   
Will it be possible to study courses with another university to complete my Major/Minor/Augmentation?   Specific external courses offered by other top Australian universities may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Students will need to make a strong case as to why they are unable to complete the approved ANU course substitute.  Please first review the approved course substitutions on our website (see: Engineering course substitutions ). If you believe you may be unnecessarily disadvantaged by completing the approved replacement ANU course, and wish to submit an alternate, external course for consideration, then you will need to submit this request.  You must provide a personal statement detailing your circumstances and the published course outline for the course that you’ve identified to CECC Student Services (at studentadmin.cecc@anu.edu.au ). This request will then be considered by the relevant Delegated Authority and a formal decision will be communicated to you (and recorded on your internal record). If the courses I have completed to date can’t count towards my new program or Major, will I be permitted to Late Withdraw from these courses and receive a tuition fee refund?  CECC Student Services will work with you and the Research School to find the best fit for the courses you have successfully completed to date in your program. We will record approved substitutions to ensure there is no confusion at the time of graduation. We will also identify which courses you have remaining to complete under your new program rules, so that you can make an informed decision about your study plans. Where courses that have been successfully completed within the last 12 months are identified as surplus to your new program requirements, and are therefore not able to fit within the new program, Student Services will discuss the options available to you that align with your individual circumstances.    
I'd like to transfer to a completely different degree program, as my current Major/Augmentation is being disestablished. How do I do this?  If you decide that you would like to transfer to an entirely different program as a result of the approved changes (for example, to move from the Master of Engineering to the Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision), you will need to submit an application for Program Transfer. For transfers to be effective from Semester 1 2021, you must submit a completed application by no later than 31 October 2020.  More information: Transferring between degrees

It will depend on how far through your current degree you are. If this is the case, this will be explicitly identified as part of your study plan discussion with CECC Student Services, so that you can make an informed decision about your options.    
Will current ANU students who transfer into an engineering program from 2021 be able to complete one of the disestablished Majors/Minors/Augmentations? Or are they treated as a new commencing student?    Students who transfer into an ANU engineering degree from 2021 will typically be expected to complete their studies under the year rules that they commence their engineering program.
